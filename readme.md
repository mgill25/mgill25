### Hello

My name is Manish. You can pronounce it as _Mun_ (like the Sun) + eesh.

I like to build large scale distributed systems that are reliable and resilient.

At my day job, I work at TomTom in Berlin. I write Scala and Python. I've also done professional Java, Go, Lua, Javascript and a lot of Python. 

I also have a special love for SQL and enjoy working with data storage systems - DBMS, caches, logs, message queues, warehouses and data lakes.

In my own time, I write Rust and Zig.
