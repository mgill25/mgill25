### Hello

My name is Manish. You can pronounce it as _Mun_ (like the Sun) + eesh.

I like to build large scale distributed systems that are reliable and resilient, and perform well.

At my day job, I work at TomTom in Berlin. I write Scala and Python. I've also done professional Java, Go, Lua, Javascript and a lot of Python.

In my own time, I write Rust.
